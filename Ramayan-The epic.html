<div><p style="text-align:bottom;font-family:times-new roman;font-size:large;color:white;">The Ramayana written by Tulsidas known 
as <span style="color:orange">Ramcharitmanas</span>,is a sixteenth century epic. The story evolves around <span style="color:orange">Rama</span>,who was the seventh avatar of the Hindu God <span style="color:orange">Vishnu</span>. He is the central figure of the Hindu epic <span style="color:orange">Ramayana</span>,which is the principal narration of events connected to his incarnations on earth,his ideals and his greatness. 
<span style="color:orange"> His soul motive was to destroy evil forces on Earth and relieve kind people</span>. He was the eldest son 
of King Dashratha-ruler of the Kosala Kingdom or Adhyodha, Present-day Uttar Pradesh. Rama's life and journey is one of adherence to 
dharma despite harsh treats and obstacles and many pairs of life and time. This adherence made him earn the name 
of <span style="color:orange">Maryada Purushottam Ram</span> which literally means <span style="color:orange">The Perfect Man</span> 
or <span style="color:orange">Lord of Self-Control</span> or <span style="color:orange">Lord of Virtue</span>. For the sake of his 
father's honour, Rama abandoned his claim to Adhyodha's throne to serve an exile of fourtenn years in the forest. His wife Sita and 
brother Lakshmana decide to join him and all three spend the fourteen years in exile together. While in 
exile, <span style="color:orange">Sita was kidnapped by Ravana,the demon king of Lanka, Present-day Sri Lanka</span>. After a long and 
ardous search, Rama fights a colossal war against Ravana's armies. In a war of powerful and magical beings,greatly destructive weaponery 
and battles, Rama slays Ravana in battle and liberates his wife. Having completed his exile, Rama returns to be crowned king in Adhyodha 
and eventually becomes the emperor. The whole is is divided into seven parts known as Kandas.<span style="color:red"> Below is the link
